Salt is a subproject of PlantUML
that may help you to design graphical interface or Website Wireframe or Page Schematic or Screen Blueprint.
It is invaluable in crafting graphical interfaces, schematics, and blueprints.
It aids in aligning conceptual structures with visual design, emphasizing functionality over aesthetics.
Wireframes, central to this process, are used across various disciplines.
