A Timing Diagram in UML is a specific type of interaction diagram that visualizes the timing constraints of a system.
It focuses on the chronological order of events, showcasing how different objects interact with each other over time.
Timing diagrams are especially useful in real-time systems and embedded systems
to understand the behavior of objects throughout a given period.

See [PlantUML Timing Diagram](https://plantuml.com/en/timing-diagram) for more information.
