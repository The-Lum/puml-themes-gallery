An object diagram is a graphical representation that showcases objects and their relationships at a specific moment in
time.
It provides a snapshot of the system's structure,
capturing the static view of the instances present and their associations.

See [PlantUML Object Diagram](https://plantuml.com/en/object-diagram) for more information.
