State diagrams provide a visual representation of the various states a system or an object can be in,
as well as the transitions between those states.
They are essential in modeling the dynamic behavior of systems,
capturing how they respond to different events over time.
State diagrams depict the system's life cycle, making it easier to understand, design, and optimize its behavior.
