A Deployment Diagram is a type of diagram that visualizes the architecture of systems,
showcasing how software components are deployed onto hardware.
It provides a clear picture of the components' distribution across various nodes,
such as servers, workstations, and devices.

See [PlantUML Deployment Diagram](https://plantuml.com/en/deployment-diagram) for more information.
