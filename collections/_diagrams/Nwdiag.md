A network diagram is a visual representation of a computer or telecommunications network.
It illustrates the arrangement and interconnections of network components,
including servers, routers, switches, hubs, and devices.
Network diagrams are invaluable tools for network engineers and administrators to understand,
set up, and troubleshoot networks.
They are also essential for visualizing the structure and flow of data in a network,
ensuring optimal performance and security.
