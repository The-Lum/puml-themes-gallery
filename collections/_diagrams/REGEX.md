Regular expressions (Regex) are powerful tools in programming, used for pattern matching and text manipulation.
While extremely useful, regex patterns can often be dense and challenging to interpret,
especially as they grow in complexity.
The syntax, although efficient, can become obscure and hard to read for both beginners and experienced developers.
This is where visual tools like PlantUML come into play.

See [PlantUML Regex Diagram](https://plantuml.com/en/regex) for more information.
