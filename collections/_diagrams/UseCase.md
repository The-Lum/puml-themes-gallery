A use case diagram is a visual representation used in software engineering to depict the interactions between system
actors and the system itself.
It captures the dynamic behavior of a system by illustrating its use cases and the roles
that interact with them.
These diagrams are essential in specifying the system's functional requirements and
understanding how users will interact with the system.
By providing a high-level view, use case diagrams help
stakeholders understand the system's functionality and its potential value.
