A Gantt Chart is a powerful tool used for project management.
It visually represents a project schedule,
allowing managers and team members to see the start and end dates of the entire project at a glance.
The diagram displays tasks or activities along a horizontal time axis,
showing the duration of each task, their sequence, and how they overlap or run concurrently.

See [PlantUML Gantt Chart](https://plantuml.com/en/gantt) for more information.
