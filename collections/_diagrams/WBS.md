A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) diagram is a key project management tool that breaks down a project into smaller,
more manageable components or tasks.
It's essentially a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team
to achieve the project goals and create the required deliverables.

See [PlantUML Work Breakdown Structure Diagram](https://plantuml.com/en/wbs-diagram) for more information.
