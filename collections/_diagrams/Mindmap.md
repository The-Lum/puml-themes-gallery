A MindMap diagram, in the context of PlantUML, is an effective tool for brainstorming,
organizing ideas, and project planning.
MindMap diagrams, or mind maps, are visual representations of information,
where central ideas branch out into related topics, creating a spider-web of concepts.
PlantUML facilitates the creation of these diagrams with its simple, text-based syntax,
allowing for the efficient organization and visualization of complex ideas.
